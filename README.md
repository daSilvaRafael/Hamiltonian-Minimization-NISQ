# Hamiltonian Minimization in the NISQ Era

This repository has the jupyter notebook with the results discussed on the authorâ€™s paper _Hamiltonian Minimization in the NISQ Era_. The paper outlines the use of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers for Hamiltonian minimization problems. We delve into the mathematical formulation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), Quantum Annealing (QA), and Quantum Approximation Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), with computational results for a 3-qubit minimization problem and its extension to 6-qubit, 13-qubit and 140-qubit problem run on central processor unit (CPU), quantum simulator (QS) and quantum processor unit (QPU). We show how different initial parameters leads to optimal, less accurate, or no satisfactory solutions using the considered versions of VQE and QAOA, a well known challenge. For all problems, the optimal solution was found using QA and hybrid solvers. This work serves as a hands-on approach to understand quantum annealing, variational quantum
algorithms, quantum hardware limitations and current landscape.
